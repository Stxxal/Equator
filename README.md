# Equator
A python project which permutates equations with one another to derive newer equations.

## Overview
Equator is a symbolic computation tool that reads equations from a file and generates every possible valid transformation. It systematically applies mathematical rules to derive new equations while preserving equivalence.

## Features
- Reads equations from a file
- Generates all possible transformations of the equations
- Supports a variety of mathematical operations and transformations
- Outputs the derived equations to a file
- Can handle complex equations with multiple variables and operations
- Includes a set of predefined transformation rules
